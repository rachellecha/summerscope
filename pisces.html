                        <p>You are affectionate and artistic. Even though everyone is social distancing, you can still love on the people you care about by writing them letters. Pick a person each day and write a letter to them about how much they mean to you. This is sure to brighten anyone’s day. Also consider starting a garden. With your affectionate nature, Pisces are the perfect people to take up gardening. Many people say that saying kind words to plants helps them grow. Shower your plants with love and watch them blossom.  Using your artistic nature, you should paint! Paint whatever you want whether it’s a portrait, landscape, or whatever you want. Get your creative juices flowing.
