                            You are super practical and analytical. This is the perfect time to start learning about and investing in stocks if you are not already. Being familiar with stocks is an important part of adulting that everyone should start thinking about during this time. You’re also a loyal friend and this is a great time to think about everyone who you should connect back with. Now is a time to really focus on all of your friendships. Especially now that we are all online, you have no excuses to reach out to those who you don’t normally get to see in person anyways. On top of that, we all know that you have a list of books you’ve been meaning to get to in the back of your head. This summer, start making your way through all those books!
