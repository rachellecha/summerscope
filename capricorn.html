                        <p>You are independent and disciplined. Capricorns can’t just sit around and do nothing when there are things to do and money to be made! Go get that bread and apply for some remote jobs or do online surveys for money so you can become more financially independent. Save that money so you can treat yourself to a shopping spree once Corona is over! Channel your disciplined nature to try and write that book you’ve always wanted to write. It could be about anything but make sure you are passionate about what you write about. Who knows, maybe you can be the next bestseller.
