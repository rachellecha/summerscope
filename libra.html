Being the social and diplomatic person that you are, you should explore that side of you by starting a podcast. Choose a niche and record a season this summer! If that’s not your cup of tea because you hate the sound of your own voice or because you don’t know what to talk about in a deep manner, you can channel your gracious side too. Use this time to start a nonprofit for a cause that you are deeply passionate about!
