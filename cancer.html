                            Cancers are known to be sentimental, and even though this may not necessarily be the summer of our dreams, you are living in a part of history. This is the summer to create a scrapbook to keep all of your memories. Lean into your creative side and invest in this scrapbook so that you can keep some good memories forever. You are super intuitive and you should also use your intuition to learn a new language this summer too. When this quarantine is all over, you never know when youâ€™ll be able to use that new language! Lastly and most importantly, take this time to spend some time with family, whether you can be there in person or that means calling them.
